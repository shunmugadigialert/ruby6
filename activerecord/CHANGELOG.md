*   The `db:prepare` task no longer loads seeds when a non-primary database is created.

    Previously, the `db:prepare` task would load seeds whenever a new database is created, leading
    to potential loss of data if a database is added to an existing environment.

    Introduces a new database config property `seeds` to control whether seeds are loaded during
    `db:prepare` which defaults to `true` for primary database configs and `false` otherwise.

    Fixes #53348.
